## Experiments-with-git
Testing all features of git here

### features to test : 
- gitignore
- rebasing
- squashing all commits
- different types of meeting
- cherry picking
- making new branch and using it to resolve merge conflicts
- undoing commits

### features tested :
- gitignore
if it doesn't work do 
**git rm -r --cached .**  
This clears out the cache which already has files and folders in it  
Then do the regular add , commit and push.

- making new branch and using it to resolve merge conflicts
